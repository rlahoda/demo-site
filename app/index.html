        <h1>What is Spiritual Formation?</h1>
        <div class="subsection flow">
          <p>
            You may be familiar with the term discipleship but maybe not
            spiritual formation. In discipleship, our participation with God in
            His story makes us disciples. This is our status. Spiritual
            formation is the inner process of discipleship. With our
            participation, Christ is at work internally forming us through His
            Spirit so that our character can reflect His image.
          </p>

          <h2>We were created in God's image to reflect His image!</h2>

          <blockquote>
            <sup class="verse-number">26a</sup>"Then God said, "Let us make
            human beings in our image, to be like us. …
            <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>So God created human beings in his
            own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he
            created them."<br />
            <sup class="attribution">(Genesis 1:26a-27, NLT)</sup>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Then God blessed Adam and Eve and gave them three assignments
            <span class="attribution">(Gen 1:28)</span>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Be fruitful and multiply</li>
            <li>Fill and subdue the earth,</li>
            <li>govern/reign</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Let's look at these assignments in light of humanity as image
            bearers:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Be fruitful and multiply His image
            </li>
            <li>
              to fill Earth with His image
            </li>
            <li>
              in order to govern and reign to reflect His image over all
              creation.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Then sin beget sin, and you know the story.</h2>

          <p>
            We know that in Christ, we are new creations, the old has gone and
            the new is here <span class="attribution">(2 Cor 5:17)</span>. But
            sometimes, or maybe even often, we don't feel like new creations do
            we? We get stuck in old sin patterns. We respond too harshly, we
            lack patience, we rush and don't see someone in need. This is why
            Paul tells us to "continue to work out your salvation with fear and
            trembling…"
            <span class="attribution">(Philippians 2:12b-13, NIV)</span> Notice
            that Paul beckons us to action despite God working in us. This is
            good news! We are to be neither puppets nor puppeteers but partners
            with God, colaboring with Him in writing our shared story.
          </p>

          <h2>What does this have to do with Spiritual Formation?</h2>

          <p>
            Our spirits are constantly being formed whether or not we are
            Christian. We have the same assignment today that God gave Adam and
            Eve! We need to colabor with God so that our reflection mirrors
            Christ's image to the world. This involves being rooted in spiritual
            formation practices. Just as a tree's roots not only anchor it in
            the rich soil and supply it with water and nutrients but also keep
            the surrounding soil from being washed away, likewise, spiritual
            formation anchors us relationally in Christ, quenching our thirst
            and allowing us to absorb His richness so that we can be an anchor
            for others.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <sup class="verse-number">1</sup>"Since, then, you have been raised
            with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is,
            seated at the right hand of God.
            <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>Set your minds on things above, not
            on earthly things."<br />
            <span class="attribution">(Colossians 3:1-2 NIV)</span>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            A foundational practice in spiritual formation is setting our hearts
            and minds on things above. Dallas Willard says that God is as close
            as the air we breathe. God is not sitting up somewhere distant and
            uninvolved, so think of above not as the physical distance to God
            but as the distance from ordinary to holy. When we focus our minds
            and hearts on God, we become self-forgetting. We can then align our
            will with His.

        <h1>Spiritual Practices</h1>

        <h2>Lectio Divina: Holy Reading</h2>
        <div class="subsection flow">
          <ul>
            <li>Read Colossians 3:1-17</li>
            <li>Memorize or Pray the passage</li>
            <li>
              Practice Meditative Prayer. This kind of prayer involves the mind
              and the heart (as Col 3:1-2 mentions). The Bible is God’s living
              word. It was written to people in a specific time and place, but
              it is for us today as well. When we pray scripture meditatively,
              we ask God to show us what the passage means to us. My favorite
              meditative prayer is lectio divina (pronounced lexio diveena).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Ready/Preparation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Relax and come fully into the present</li>
            <li>Become consciously aware of God's presence with you</li>
            <li>
              Express your willingness to hear from God with a brief prayer such
              as "Come Lord Jesus" or "Here I am."
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Read (Lectio, Reading)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read slowly, pausing between phrases and sentences, and let your
              awareness rest on each word. This text is for all who are thirsty.
            </li>
            <li>
              As you reread, listen for the word or phrase that strikes you or
              catches your attention. This word is meant for you.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Reflect (Meditatio, Meditation)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read the passage again and listen for the way this word connects
              to your life
            </li>
            <li>
              This is the Living Word of God. How is my present life touched by
              this word?
            </li>
            <li>
              What is it in my life right now that needs to hear this word?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Respond (Oratio, Prayer)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Read the passage again.</li>
            <li>What is God trying to say to me?</li>
            <li>
              What is my response to God based on what I have read and
              encountered?
            </li>
            <li>
              Enter into a dialogue with God; listen for your deepest and truest
              response and allow your prayer to flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Share with God any feeling the text has aroused: joy, fear,
              sorrow, anger, love, conviction, desire, need, comfort, peace
            </li>
            <li>
              Is God calling you to act or respond? It may be helpful to
              journal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Rest (Contemplatio, Contemplation)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Read the passage one last time.</li>
            <li>
              Release and return to a quiet, wordless rest in God and His Word.
            </li>
            <li>Rest in His one-of-a-kind, unconditional love.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Resolve/Return</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Resolve to carry this word with you and live it out in the context
              of daily life.
            </li>
            <li>
              As you listen for this word throughout your day, you will be led
              deeper into its meaning, until it begins to live in you and you
              enflesh this word.<br />
              It may be helpful for some to turn their word or phrase into a
              short prayer or choose an image, picture, or symbol that you can
              carry to remind you of it.
            </li>

            <li>Explore the question, Who is God?</li>
          </ul>

          About the Author
        </h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Kristy Lahoda. I am married to Rob, and we have three
          children. Rob and I have a passion for relationship. I have my B.S.
          and Ph.D. in chemistry and currently work as a freelance scientific
          technical editor. I love to write fiction and watercolor. I’m in my
          second year for spiritual formation certification through the Renovaré
          Institute for Spiritual Formation, Chicago cohort (<a
            href="http://www.renovare.org"
            >renovare.org</a
          >) and am in the process of discerning if further higher education is
          in my future.

        <p>
          Richard J. Foster, the founder of Renovaré, says Conversatio morum is
          hard to translate. In Prayer: Finding the Heart’s True Home, Foster
          says, “Negatively, it means death to the status quo, death to things
          as they have always been. Positively, it means constant change,
          constant conversion, constant openness to the movings of the Spirit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to name this newsletter something that would highlight the
          very nature of spiritual formation, that is, that it is a
          transformational process. Chris Hall, the president of Renovaré says,
          “Spiritual formation is the slowest of all Christian movements.” Take
          heart though, patience is a fruit of the Spirit. As we progress in the
          Way, we become more fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual formation practices are like any practice we pursue be it
          athletics, the arts, or others. We must train to progress. This
          involves growth and change. As we progress on our faith journey, we
          become more and more like Christ. We transform. My hope is to combine
          and share my vocations of writing and teaching spiritual formation so
          that we can grow together in Christ to reflect His image to the world.
          So be it.
